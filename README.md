## How to Use

1. Open the application.
2. Click "Start Recording."
3. Say your procedure instructions out loud into your microphone, being specific. Saying "Note" will increase the chance of it making a note for the step you're describing. 
4. Click "Stop Recording."
5. The application will automatically transcribe your recording, convert it into a structured procedure, and save it as a CSV file.
6. In Epsilon, on the Procedures page, click "Import" (next to "New Procedure") and import the generated CSV file. 
7. In Epsilon click "Convert to Draft".
8. Make any required edits or insert photos. 

It's best for a first draft so sanity check the created procedure.

## Future Improvements

- Output folder with audio files, transcriptions, GPT interpretations and parsed CSVs
- Unique filenames for CSV outputs
- Epsilon Field inputs
- Status log that shows processes in real time (instead of hanging and showing all complete tasks once done)
- Automatic photo insertion (take photos as you record your instructions, and have them automatically inserted at the right times)
- Upload audio file (instead of using the recorder feature)
